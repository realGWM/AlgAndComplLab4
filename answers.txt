# task2:
O(N)
where N is the size of s
# task3:
O(N*M)
where N and M are height and width of the matrix
alternatively, we can say that it is O(N) where N is the amount of elements in the matrix.
# task4:
O(1)
# task5:
A tought one for me.
It's obvious that the best case is O(1) (the first elemest is true).
It's also obvious that the worst case is O(N) (all the elements are false).
But what is the average case?..
I'd say O(N) but I don't know how to prove it...
# task6:
O(N^2)
where N is the size of vec
